## Hippocratic License 3.0 (HL3): An Ethical License for Open Source Communities

For too long, we as software developers have divorced ourselves from the consequences of the code that we write. We have told ourselves that development is a pure and abstract pursuit, and have spent our careers writing programs with the goals of clarity, conciseness, readability, performance, and elegance.

But we are starting to realize that the software that we create has a real and lasting impact on the world in which we live.

 It outlines a clear set of ethical standards that licensees must abide by in order to adopt the software code covered by the license. These standards were derived from a variety of international agreements and authority on international human rights norms, such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and the International Labour Organization.

Politics and software are so tangled that they cannot be reasonably separated. Consider the GPS software that tells you how to get to a restaurant; it's also used to direct military drones to their targets. The facial recognition software  that unlocks your phone? It's being used to record, track, and target the activities of political dissenters.

All of these technologies are inherently political. There is no neutral political position in technology. You can't build systems that can be weaponized against marginalized people and take no responsibility for them.

Open source licenses have long been the primary tool for promoting the use of our software under our own rules and conditions. In the past these licenses were used to allow the free distribution, modification, and use of our software. But there is nothing stopping us from taking this further.

Introducing the Hippocratic License: an Ethical Source license that specifically prohibits the use of software to violate universal standards of human rights, and embodying the [Ethical Source Principles](https://ethicalsource.dev/principles).
