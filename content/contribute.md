### Participate in the Ethical Licensure Incubator program
In partnership with [Corporate Accountability Lab (CAL)](http://corpaccountabilitylab.org), the Organization for Ethical Source's Ethical Licensure Incubator program brings together open source maintainers and human rights workers with a dedicated legal team with expertise at the intersection of intellectual property and human rights.

Our incubator program also supports the development of other ethical source licenses that prioritize specific areas of justice and equity in open source.

If you'd like to participate in this program, sign up for membership in the OES at [ethicalsource.dev/join](https://ethicalsource.dev/join/).

### Support HL3 Financially
You can support our work with a one-time or recurring donation through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ethical-source).
