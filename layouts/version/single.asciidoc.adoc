Very hacky way of converting markdown to asciidoc.
Because the covenant uses rather simple syntax, we can get away with this :)

Order of operations is:
* Replace markdown # headers for = asciidoc
* Transform links in the form of [text][reference] to text + remove reference links at end.
  This is similar to what the txt conversion does, and it's very hard to convert with just regexps -- if we want to
  keep these links it'll probably be easier to just convert them to [text](url) format.
* Transform links in the form of [text](url) to asciidoc's link:url[text]
* Transform links in the <url> form to asciidoc's link:url[url]
